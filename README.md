# Visualization workshop by Martin Sikora

In this workshop Martin gave some overview on how to create cool plots in ggplot2 and gave also some tips and tricks about how to make them look nicer. 

The workshop has several excersizes built in the learnr package. You can either render it locally and run it from your computer or you can use the shiny version.

The first part is deployed here:
